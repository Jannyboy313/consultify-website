## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\
Run `ng build --prod` to create the files for hosting the website.

## Explanation

This is a fake company made by me for a school project (2nd Year).
In this school project we need to represent ourselves with our own company.\
I thought that only a name and logo is not realistic enough so we bought a domain for a professional email.
And when you have a domain you also need a website. So I build with enthusiasm this site within a day.
